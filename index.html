            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>People who love to eat are always the best people. To eat is a necessity, but to eat intelligently is an art. We all eat, an it would be a sad waste of opportunity to eat badly. If you really want to make a friend, go to someone's house and eat with him.</p>
